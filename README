This is the source repo for the ClojureDays Foundation website.

Pushes to the master branch on github will automatically update the
website at https://foundation.clojuredays.org/

Implemented using GitHub pages with Jekyll templating.

You can run the templating engine locally using jekyll:


  # install a recentish Ruby
  $ gem install --user-install bundler jekyll
  $ bundle exec jekyll serve

Note that some changes will require a restart of the jekyll process.
