# The ClojureDays Foundation Policy Plan 2025

We started the ClojureDays foundation to ensure the continuity of the
[yearly, free, Dutch Clojure Days
conference](https://clojuredays.org/).

I've been involved in organizing the conference for the last 5 years, and it's been
extremely fun and rewarding work to create an educational and social
event for an international group of people who may know each other by
their online work but who generally have very little face-to-face
time.

I'm proud of the fact that thanks to our hospitable volunteers, generous
sponsors and entertaining speakers the quality of the conference has been
improving every year while keeping the conference 100% free.

In creating the foundation we established an independent entity that
will support the conference going further and can expand into more
community-oriented activities.

# Terms

This policy plan spans the current financial year, January 2025 till December 2025.

# Mission, vision and strategy

We support the computer programmer community worldwide, our main focus
is on the community surrounding the Clojure programming language in
the Netherlands.

We aim to achieve the goal by organising and supporting conferences,
meetups, workshops, development of open source software libraries
and other related activities.

# Current situation, activities

## Last yearly conference

The last yearly conference has happened in October 2022. Due to the lack of capacity
we have been skipping our yearly conference ever since.

## ClojureDays 2026 conference

We will organize the [Dutch Clojure Days
2026](https://clojuredays.org) annual conference to be held in May 2026.
The conference will host about 130 people and will be free of
charge for attendees.

Board members volunteer their time and receive only compensation for
reasonable expenses made doing their work for the foundation.

The foundation employs no people.

# Finances & Funding

To finance the conference and other activities we're attracting
corporate sponsors who will provide funds in exchange for exposure to
the Clojure programming community.

Based on our data from the previous conferences we expect costs for
the 2026 conference to be €16,000 - €20,000 all in.

We aim to keep the remaining amount of funds, estimated at €5,000 depending
on sponsoring details and expenses, for foundation operating costs
(mostly infrastructure and administration costs) and general reserves
for following conferences and events if sponsoring brings in less than expected.

The current fiscal year will run from January 2025 till 31
December 2025. We will provide a financial report within 6 months
after the end of the fiscal year.

# After 2025

During 2025 we will be busy organizing the 2026 Dutch Clojure Days conference.
In Q1 2026 a new policy plan will be published, detailing the Foundation plan
for such year.
