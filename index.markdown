# Policy plan outline

This is the outline of our policy plan. More details can be found in
[The ClojureDays Foundation Policy Plan 2020](policy-2020.html).

## Goals

We support the computer programmer community worldwide, our main focus
is on the community surrounding the Clojure programming language in
the Netherlands.

We aim to achieve the goal by organising and supporting conferences,
meetups, workshops, development of open source software libraries
and other related activities.

## Establishment end of 2019

In november 2019, we established the foundation.

## ClojureDays 2020 conference

We will organize the [Dutch Clojure Days
2020](https://clojuredays.org) annual conference to be held in may
2020. The conference will host about 150 people and will be free of
charge for attendees.

## Funding

To finance the conference and other activities we're attracting
corporate sponsors to the conference who will provide funds in
exchange for exposure to the Clojure programming community.

Based on data from previous conferences we expect costs for the 2020
conference to be about €16,000 - €20,000 euros all in.

We aim to keep a limited amount of funds for foundation operating
costs (mostly infrastructure and administration costs) and general
reserves for next year's conference if sponsoring brings in less than
expected.

## After 2020

We plan to organize another Dutch Clojure Days conference in 2021.

# Activity report

The foundation was established 11th of november 2019. We will
organise at least one conference in 2020; [Dutch Clojure Days 2020](https://clojuredays.org)

# Financial report

The first fiscal year will run from november 2019 till 31
december 2020. We will provide a financial report within 6 months
after the end of the fiscal year.
